# UWA
## 25 August 2021: when working with this repo, please make sure to update the files in pantheon too since now pantheon is used.
## Basic Usage

- _Theme Name:_ uwa
- _Local Site URL:_
- _Landing Pages:_ Custom Post Type
- _Start Date Location:_

## Getting Set Up Locally

### Install Dependencies

Install by navigating to the theme's `library` folder and running `npm install` followed by `bower install`.

### Watch Files

To start watching files use `grunt` from the `library` folder. This will run browsersync and then watch. You can now open any browser and when you make changes the browser(s) will inject the proper files automatically.

### Source Files

Source assets are stored in the "scss", "js", and "images" folders within the library. Any scss and js assets are minified through the `grunt` task. Images need to be optimized manually.

## Other Information

### Critical CSS

This theme utilizes inline styling in the head of the document for faster load times. If it seems like your changes are not working there is a chance that these inline styles are overwriting your changes.

### Custom Post Types

Custom post types can be found in the `custom-post-types.php` file within the `library` folder. Custom post types for this theme are:

- Degrees
- Landing Pages
- Resources
	+ Career Outcomes
	+ Program Resources
	+ Infographics
	+ Guides

### Degree Vertical Taxonomy Archive

Go to the taxonomy term page in the admin to edit most of the content here. The tabs with different degree levels can be modified by adding or removing rows from the Degree Level Descriptions field. If there are any child terms, they will be listed below the tabs and use the first sentence of the Intro Text field from each child term.
